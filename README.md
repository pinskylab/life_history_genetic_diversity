## Lab Paper Collection

Collected microsatellites data from lab papers.

## Research Project

Collected life history data for microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA. Created project based on the gathered information
1. **Specfic life history traits focused on:** body size, fecundity, fertilization, & reproduction mode
2. **Objective:** See relationship between the different life history traits and genetic diversity. Draw up conclusions based on findings
3. **Results:** 
   * Large body size decreased diversity
   * Large population sizes decreased or increased diversity depending on the different markers
   * External fertilization increased diversity
   * Hermaphroditic species had more diversity
