## Lab Paper Collection

Collected microsatellites data from lab papers.

## Research Project

Collected life history data for microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA. Created project based on the gathered information
-Specfic life history traits focused on: body size, fecundity, fertilization, & reproduction mode
-Objective: See relationship between the different life history traits and genetic diversity. Draw up conclusions based on findings
-Results: 
* Large body size decreased diversity
* Large population sizes decreased or increased diversity depending on the different markers
* External fertilization increased diversity
* Hermaphroditic species had more diversity
