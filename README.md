# Life Histories and Genetic Diversity

---

## Project: Variation in fish genetic diversity across life history traits

In this project, we compiled life history data and microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA genetic diversity data for marine fishes in the continental United States.
1. **Life history traits:** body size, fecundity, fertilization, & reproduction mode
2. **Objective:** Test for relationships between life history traits and genetic diversity.
