# Organization
* Box Plots
  1. Fertilization (external & internal vs. He)
  2. Reproduction mode (Dioecious & Hermaphrodites vs. He)
  3. Specific Reproduction mode (Dioecious, Protandry, Protogyny, & True Hermaphrodites vs. He)
 
* Scatter Plots
  1. Max Length (max length vs. He)
  2. Max Length w/out Rhincodon Typus (all max length points except Rhincodon Typus vs. He)
  3. Fecundity Mean (fecundity mean vs. He)

# Directory
1. **Graphs that contain "(log)":** x axis has a log transformation
2. **Graphs that contain "GLM":** there is a generalized linear model regression overlaid the scatter plot to show a more accurate representation of the relationships between the x and y
3. **Graphs that contain "no Rhincodon typus":** excludes Rhincodon typus as it is an "outlier" (makes it hard to read the plot)
4. **Graphs that contain "msat":** contains plot that has information from msat data set
5. **Graphs that contain "mtdna":** contains plot that has information from mtdna data set
