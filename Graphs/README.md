## Fecundity graphs
Contains the mixed model graphs for msat He, mtDNA Hd, and mtDNA pi. These graphs were made using [`Mixed Models Models for US Data (msat & mtDNA).R`](https://github.com/pinskylab/marial_diversity/blob/master/Scripts/Mixed%20Models%20for%20US%20Data%20(msat%20%26%20mtDNA).R)

## US maps
Contains map of Continental USA and where individuals that were analyzed in the study were located. The range taken for latitude was from 23째 to 50째 while longitude range was from -128째 to -65째. These graphs were made using [`Subsetting to US data.R`](https://github.com/pinskylab/marial_diversity/blob/master/Scripts/Subsetting%20to%20US%20data.R)
