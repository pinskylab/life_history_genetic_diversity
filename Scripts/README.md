# Scripts Directory
Contains description of each script and is placed in the order needed to run the next step. *(Note: steps 3, 4, & 5 are interchangeable as they all start off with the same csv created from step 2).*


### 1. [Subsetting to US data.R](https://github.com/pinskylab/marial_diversity/blob/master/Scripts/Subsetting%20to%20US%20data.R)
Used to subset marine species' data from the original microsatellite and mitchondrial DNA to just Continental USA. The range taken for latitude was from 23째 to 50째 while longitude range was from -128째 to -65째. This script starts of the rest of the pathway.


### 2. [Pull LH traits.R](https://github.com/pinskylab/marial_diversity/blob/master/Scripts/Pull%20LH%20traits.R)
Used to pull life history traits for both microsatellite and mitchondrial DNA species from Fishbase.


### 3. [US Graphs.R](https://github.com/pinskylab/marial_diversity/blob/master/Scripts/Subsetting%20to%20US%20data.R)
Used to analyze and graph data for microsatellite and mitchondrial DNA US data. Includes steps to graph:
* Fertilization method
* Reproduction mode
* Maps of Continental USA with sample locations plotted  

### 4. [Mixed Models for US Data (msat & mtDNA).R](https://github.com/pinskylab/marial_diversity/blob/master/Scripts/Mixed%20Models%20for%20US%20Data%20(msat%20%26%20mtDNA).R)
Used to analyze and create mixed models for microsatellite and mitchondrial DNA samples. It also includes steps to graph:
* Maximum length
* Fecundity

### 5. [Data Characteristics](https://github.com/pinskylab/marial_diversity/blob/master/Scripts/Data%20charactersitics.R)
Used to look at the datasets and see the different characteristics. For example: looking at number of sources or number of each reproduction category.
